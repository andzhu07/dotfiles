# Legacy colorschemes

This directory contains the original colorschemes distributed with Vim, in the state they were when we started work on the remakes.

If you don't like the remake of your favourite colorscheme, you can grab the original here and drop it in your `colors/` directory as-is. Since it comes first in `&runtimepath` it will take precedence over the one distributed with Vim.

On Windows:

    %userprofile%\vimfiles\colors\peachpuff.vim

On Unix-like systems:

    $HOME/.vim/colors/peachpuff.vim
